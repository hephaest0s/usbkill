« usbkill » is a kill-switch that waits for a change on your USB ports and then immediately shuts down your computer. Anti-forensic.

> The project is still under development but it does work and is effective. Expect improvements to come. Custom commands for when a USB change is observed will be implemented.

To run:

```shell
sudo python3 usbkill.py
```

### Why?

In case the police or other thugs come busting in (or steal your laptop from you when you are at a public library as happened to Ross). You can use this as an anti-forensic measure. 

The police commonly uses a « [mouse jiggler](http://www.amazon.com/Cru-dataport-Jiggler-Automatic-keyboard-Activity/dp/B00MTZY7Y4/ref=pd_bxgy_pc_text_y/190-3944818-7671348) » to keep the screensaver and sleep mode from activating.

If you are attacked this way, you would like your computer to shut down for your immediately.

> **Important**: Make sure to use full disk encryption! Otherwise they will get in anyway. 

> **Tip**: Additionally, you may use a cord to attach a usb key to your wrist. Then insert the key into your computer and start usbkill. If they steal your computer, the USB will be removed and the computer shuts down immediately.

### Note for OS X users

In order to work on OS X, you have to install *lsusb* port along with *python3* by using [brew](http://brew.sh):

```shell
brew update && \
brew tap jlhonora/lsusb && \
brew install python3 && \
