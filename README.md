« usbkill » is an anti-forensic kill-switch that waits for a change on your USB ports and then immediately shuts down your computer.

To install:
```shell
sudo python setup.py install
```

To install as a daemon on OSX:
```shell
sudo python setup.py install --osx-daemon
```

If installing as a daemon on OSX, if you wish to use a usb device, first run:
```shell
sudo launchctl stop USBKill
```
and restart the daemon when you have removed the device:
```shell
sudo launchctl start USBKill
```
please read the usbkill.ini (/etc/usbkill.ini after installation) for instructions on whitelisting usb devices!


To run:

```shell
sudo python usbkill.py
```
or
```shell
sudo python3 usbkill.py
```

### Why?

Some reasons to use this tool:

- In case the police or other thugs come busting in (or steal your laptop from you when you are at a public library, as happened to Ross). The police commonly uses a « [mouse jiggler](http://www.amazon.com/Cru-dataport-Jiggler-Automatic-keyboard-Activity/dp/B00MTZY7Y4/ref=pd_bxgy_pc_text_y/190-3944818-7671348) » to keep the screensaver and sleep mode from activating.
- You don’t want someone to add or copy documents to or from your computer via USB.
- You want to improve the security of your (encrypted) home or corporate server (e.g. Your Raspberry).

> **[!] Important**: Make sure to use disk encryption for all folders that contain information you want to be private. Otherwise they will get it anyway. Full disk encryption is the easiest and surest option if available

> **Tip**: Additionally, you may use a cord to attach a USB key to your wrist. Then insert the key into your computer and start usbkill. If they steal your computer, the USB will be removed and the computer shuts down immediately.

### Feature List
